# The GymMo App

The GymMo app gives users access to a catalog of video workout tutorials that demonstrate how to use gym equipment to target specific muscle groups. Users will also have access to a library of motivational audio recording that they can listen to at any time. Hitting the gym is only ⅓ of the work, Your mental growth plays a role in your physical growth as well. Users will also have a space to keep journal entries about their mood, body aches and how they’ve been feeling about their fitness journey. 

I built this app in two weeks usuing ReactJS Hooks and CSS for styling.
My goal while building this app were to incorporate CRUD functionality and gain a deeper understanding of React hooks and how to properly track state.
